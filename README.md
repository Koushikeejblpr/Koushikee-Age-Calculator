üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling and creating a responsive layout. Loaded via CDN.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all the logic, including date calculations and DOM manipulation.

Google Fonts: Uses the 'Inter' font family for clean and readable typography.

üìÑ Project Structure
The entire application is contained within a single index.html file. This approach was chosen for its simplicity, portability, and ease of deployment.

The <head> section contains metadata, links to Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts, and minimal inline CSS for custom styling.

The <body> contains the HTML structure for the calculator card.

A <script> tag at the end of the <body> holds all the JavaScript logic.

üé® Design Philosophy
The design is intentionally minimalist and task-focused.

Single-Card Layout: All content is presented within a single, centered card to keep the user focused on the primary task of calculating their age.

Intuitive Flow: The user flow is simple: provide an input, and get an immediate output. This reduces cognitive load and makes the application very easy to use.

Modern Aesthetics: The use of soft shadows, rounded corners, a clean color palette (neutrals with an indigo accent), and ample whitespace creates a modern and visually appealing interface.
